### Drug-drug interaction


## Problem
In this example, we attempt to infer unknown DDIs from a network of
multiple drug-based similarities and known interactions. 

## Dataset
Each dataset below  contain seven drugâ€“drug similarities. Four of these
similarity measures are drug-based: Chemical-based, Ligand-based,
Side-effect-based and Annotation-based. Three similarities are be-
tween drug targets and computed by aggregating over known targets
for the drugs: Sequence-based, PPI network-based, and Gene
Ontology-based. 

- general-interactions: This dataset came from DrugBank version 4.3 for a total of 4293 interactiosn across 315 drugs.  There is also a file DrugBankIDs, which maps integer IDs to DrugIDs
- crd-interactions: This dataset came from DrugBank and Drugs.com for a total of 10,106 CRD interactions across 807 drugs. These IDs are anonymized (so there is no DrugBankID mapping)
- ncrd-interactions: This dataset came from DrugBank and Drugs.com for a total of 45,737 NCRD interactions across 807 drugs. These IDs are also anonymized. 

## Experimental Setup
The best threshold chosen for AUC evaluations is 0.4.
