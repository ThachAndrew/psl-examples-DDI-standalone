### Drug-drug interaction

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to infer unknown DDIs from a network of
multiple drug-based similarities and known interactions. 

## Dataset
The dataset came from DrugBank version 4.3 for a total of 315 drugs 
The dataset also contain seven drugâ€“drug similarities. Four of these
similarity measures are drug-based: Chemical-based, Ligand-based,
Side-effect-based and Annotation-based. Three similarities are be-
tween drug targets and computed by aggregating over known targets
for the drugs: Sequence-based, PPI network-based, and Gene
Ontology-based.
