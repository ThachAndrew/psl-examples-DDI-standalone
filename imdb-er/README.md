# IMDB-ER

An entity resolution problem based on IMDB data.
This work was a joint effort with Sandia National Labs.
Note that this grounded model is large and will likely require more than 50GB of RAM when grounded normally.

## Dataset

This dataset it based on data from [the Internet Movie Database (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).
The raw data was manipulated to construct an entity resolution problem as described in [Entity Resolution at Large Scale: Benchmarking and Algorithmics](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1493841) (citation below).
